<h2 id="introduction">Introduction 💡</h2>
This project focuses on data analytics and visualization using Power BI, where you will explore three key datasets: Diversity-Inclusion-Dataset, Churn-Dataset, and Call-Center-Dataset. Through the analysis, relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover are identified, and insightful visualizations are created to represent them effectively.

<h2 id="about-the-dataset"> About the Dataset 📊</h2>
The datasets used in this project include:

### [Diversity-Inclusion-Dataset](https://github.com/SinghPriya5/Diversity-and-Inclusion-Analytics-with-Power-BI/blob/main/03%20Diversity-Inclusion-Dataset.xlsx)
This dataset focuses on the diversity and inclusion metrics of the organization, providing insights into gender, nationality, age group, and promotion trends.

### [Churn-Dataset](https://github.com/SinghPriya5/Diversity-and-Inclusion-Analytics-with-Power-BI/blob/main/02%20Churn-Dataset.xlsx)
The churn dataset highlights employee turnover data, helping in the analysis of attrition rates across various departments, job levels, and employee demographics.

### [Call-Center-Dataset](https://github.com/SinghPriya5/Diversity-and-Inclusion-Analytics-with-Power-BI/blob/main/01%20Call-Center-Dataset.xlsx)
The call center dataset helps analyze employee performance and turnover within a call center environment, examining key factors like work hours, department, and performance ratings.

These datasets have been used to calculate various KPIs and create interactive Power BI dashboards.

- Data cleaning and transformation using Power BI
- Creating KPIs for analyzing hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover
- Designing and building interactive dashboards
- Utilizing advanced Power BI features like gauge charts, stacked bar charts, heatmaps, and box plots.

<h2 id="project-tasks"> Project Tasks 📝</h2>
- Analyzed employee hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover data.
- Created visualizations such as stacked bar charts, clustered column charts, and heatmaps.
- Used Power BI features to create meaningful KPIs and analyze trends in employee data.

<h2 id="key-insights">Key Insights 🔍</h2>
- Identified key trends in employee turnover based on age, gender, and department.
- Determined factors influencing promotion rates and performance metrics.
- Explored diversity patterns in hiring and the impact on career growth.

<h2 id="future-work">Future Work 🚀</h2>
